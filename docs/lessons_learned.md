**I learned about:** 
The Prooph libraries used to build an event-sourced system. I found the
Prooph documentation a little lacking, but the [Proophessor](https://github.com/prooph/proophessor)
and [Proophessor-do-symfony](https://github.com/prooph/proophessor-do-symfony) projects where
extremely useful!

**I learned about:** Creating a PhpSpec extension. I wanted `$this->equals()` in a specification
to call the `equals()` method on the subject. Neat.
