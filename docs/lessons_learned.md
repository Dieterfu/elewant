**I learned about:** 
PHPspec supports templates. So now we have declare(strict_types=1) and final classes by default.
(check the /.phpspec folder)

**I learned about:** 
The Prooph libraries used to build an event-sourced system. I found the
Prooph documentation a little lacking, but the [Proophessor](https://github.com/prooph/proophessor)
and [Proophessor-do-symfony](https://github.com/prooph/proophessor-do-symfony) projects where
extremely useful!

**I learned about:** Creating a PhpSpec extension. I wanted `$this->equals()` in a specification
to call the `equals()` method on the subject. Neat.

**I learned about:** The FOS JS routing bundle. I was hardcoding routes into the javascript,
but that is a problem if you ever want to change the url structure. The JS routing bundle gives
access to routes from within javascript. I followed the manual 
<http://symfony.com/doc/master/bundles/FOSJsRoutingBundle/index.html>, works like a charm.
