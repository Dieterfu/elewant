                    <p class="text">This project is the brain-child of Elena de la Fuente,
                        in combination with everyone at <a href="https://future500.nl">Future500 B.V.</a>.
                        The name is a combination of the words "want" and "elePHPant".
                        The idea is that we make it easier in the community to swap and share the lovely plush PHP mascottes,
                        the ElePHPants.
                        It was originally conceived in 2015, and consequently forgotten. Because, well, work happened...
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">When we decided to really build it, we took some time to discuss our technical options.
                        The main focus of this project is for us to learn, and maybe teach, the technologies used.
                        Check out the <a href="https://github.com/f500/elewant/blob/develop/README.md">README.md</a>
                        file on the project's <a href="https://github.com/f500/elewant/">github page</a>.
                        Most importantly, you'll see that we decided to build an EventSourced system. Why, you ask?
                    </p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p class="">Did you build this <i>just</i> so that you could use Event Sourcing??
                            <span class="blockquote-footer">@n0x13</span>
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="text">The answer, as with many things, is "it's complicated". But we really hope that by
                        building and using this system together, we can learn and experience what it's like to have an
                        event sourced project in production. A project that serves a puspose beyond classroom examples.
